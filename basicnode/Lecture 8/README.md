# JavaScript: DOM, Event Handling, Overview of Nodejs

## Event Handling

Event handling refers to the process of managing user interactions and other events in a web application. Events can be anything from a mouse click to a keypress, and handling these events properly is crucial for creating interactive applications.

#### Common Types of Events

##### Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove

##### Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress

##### Form Events: submit, change, focus, blur

##### Window Events: load, resize, scroll, unload

#### Example:

```javascript
<button onClick="alert('Button Clicked')">Click Here</button>
```

# DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

#### Key Concepts

**Document**: The entire HTML document.
**Element**: An individual component of the document (e.g., a div or p tag).
**Node**: The basic unit of the DOM. It can be an element, attribute, or text.
**Attributes**: Provide additional information about an element (e.g., class, id).

#### Manipulating DOM

=> By ID:

```javascript
const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
```

=> By ClassName:

```javascript
const elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
```

=> By TagName:

```javascript
const elements = document.getElementsByTagName("div");
```

=> By CSS Selectors:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector(".myClass");
const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");
```

### Modifying Elements

#### Changing Text Content:

```javascript
element.textContent = "New Text";
```

#### Changing HTML Content:

```javascript
element.innerHTML = "<p>New HTML</p>";
```

#### Changing Styles:

```javascript
element.style.color = "red";
```

# NodeJS

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, making it possible to build scalable network applications. It's key features include:

1. Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Non-blocking I/O operations.
2. Single-Threaded: Uses a single thread to handle multiple clients via the event loop.
3. Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
