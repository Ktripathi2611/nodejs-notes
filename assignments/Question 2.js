// Question 2: Operators and Expressions
// Problem: Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program should:
// Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
// Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the two numbers.

//arithmetic Operators
console.log("Arithmetic Opertors")
 x = parseInt(prompt("Enter the first integer:"));//prompt funnction is use to take user input 
 y = parseInt(prompt("Enter the second integer:"));
let sum = x+y // here the sum of x  and y  inputs taken from user is stored in  sum
console.log("the sum of two integer is ",sum)
let difference = x-y// here the differnce  of x  and y  inputs taken from user is stored in  differnce 
console.log(" the deffernce between two integer is  ",difference)
let product = x*y// here the product  of x  and y  inputs taken from user is stored in  product 
console.log(" the product of  two integer is",product)
let division = x/y// here the division  of x  and y  inputs taken from user is stored in  division
console.log (" the  result of the division is :" ,division)
